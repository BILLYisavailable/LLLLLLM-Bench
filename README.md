# LLLLLLM-Bench: Convenient Transformer Implementations of Long-Context Benchmarks

Currently, there are many long-context benchmarks, and their evaluation methods vary.  
In addition, many official releases do not provide a Transformers-based implementation.  
However, for newly created or modified model architectures, it is crucial to conduct evaluation with Transformers **before adapting them to vLLM**.  

Here, we share the evaluation of these benchmarks using Transformers.

## Benchmarks Supported
- NIAH: Needle in a Haystack  
- LongBench  
- LooGLE
